   <h1>Vanessa Scott</h1>

    <p>
    Hi, my name is Vanessa Scott and I am a 2nd year master's student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
    I am currently enrolled in the Data Science program and will graduate in April of 2026.
    Outside of my academic program, I am a Staff Research Supervisor at a psychiatry lab at UCSD.
    In my free time I enjoy going to the farmer's market, trying new coffee shops and taking my dogs on adventures.
    Below is an image of my older dog, Lemon, on his birthday.
