    <h1> Vanessa Scott </h1>
    <p> Hi, my name is Vanessa Scott and I am a 2nd year masters student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD)
        I am currently enrolled in the Data Science program and will graduate in April of 2026.
        Outside of my academic program, I am a Staff Research Supervisor at a psychiatry lab at UCSD.
    In my free time I enjoy going to the farmer's market, trying new coffee shops and taking my dogs on adventures.</p>
