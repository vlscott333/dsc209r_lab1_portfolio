  <section><h3>Design Choices and Rationale</h3>
    <p> <ul>
    <li> Deception Score (-2); I used selective binning to create a map to flatten contrast and squash large differentiations which translates to more unanimous access. This made a more continuos variable look binary (yes/no) and that all states have access.</li>
    <li> Deception Score (-1.5); I used a annotated box to list to display states that have at least 1 clinic to sway the observer</li>
    <li> Deception Score (-1); I used broad sweeping language for titles and annotations</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Proposition 2: The majority of Americans lack geographical access to abortive care</h2>

    <section><h3>Design Choices and Rationale</h3>
    <p> <ul>
    <li> Deception Score (+2); I used a continuous color scale so color was directly representative of percentages depicting a more accurate level of clinic access. I also added a black border to each state to help clearly define each state and highlight its color differentiation from its neighbors.</li>
    <li> Deception Score (-0.5); I used a list to display states that have >20% counties with clinics to show the disparity. This could be equally deceptive or persuasive in that it provides category of what to consider as "low-access"</li>
    <li> Deception Score (-1); I used a pointed title with emotional-charge and provided a analytical summary in annotation that provides the reader with an interpretation.</li>
     <li> Deception Score (+0.5); I used small images to highlight the states with notable high-ratios of clinics to drive home the pointed title. It is visually rooted in truths about the data and adds a memorable encoding for geographical locations associated with more clinics.</li>
    </ul>

    Reflection on Persuasion vs. Deception in Abortion Access Visualizations
  </h2>
 

  <p>
    This assignment was challenging to execute because I found it difficult to manipulate the data into deceptive formats.
    For Proposition 1, the data manipulation was the most challenging component rather than the visual itself.
    The approach that felt easiest to sway interpretation was using declarative statements that guide viewers’ conclusions.
    I also included a selective list of states,usin targeted filtering to support the narrative that all states have access to clinics.
    While it is technically true that every state has at least one clinic, the reality of access is far more nuanced.
    An attentive viewer might recognize that having a clinic does not necessarily equate to equitable or convenient access.
    It amazed me how small refinements between the two visualizations could lead viewers to interpret the data in vastly different ways.

  </p>

  <p>
    For Proposition 2, I saw how easily persuasive techniques can slip into design when the goal is to convince.
    In this visualization, the map itself offers an earnest depiction by using a continuous color spectrum to highlight variation in clinic access.
    However, the title is more emotionally charged and uses leading language such as “safe havens.”
    Even though the map represents the data truthfully, some design choices, though accurate, could still be considered selective or persuasive.
    For example, I explicitly defined “low access” in the annotation and included supporting statistics to steer the narrative rather than 
    letting viewers form their own interpretations.
  </p>

  <p>
    My key takeaway is that persuasiveness can easily overlap with deception.
    As data stewards and communicators, we hold substantial power to frame narratives, and no two analysts may approach the same problem identically.
    There is a time and place for persuasive language and strong visuals, such as in business contexts or advertising, but even there, ethical boundaries 
    must be respected. By contrast, in public policy, academic reporting, and journalism, persuasion should be minimized to preserve integrity and trust.
    Ultimately, it can be difficult to recognize when we are being persuasive versus deceptive.
    Maintaining ethical awareness should be a continual process both in reviewing our own work and in collaborating with peers—
    to ensure our visualizations and analyses communicate as close to the ground truth as possible.
    I believe the boundary between “acceptable” persuasion and “misleading” design lies in transparency:
    when a visualization highlights certain aspects of the data but still allows an informed viewer to reconstruct or verify the full picture,
    it remains within ethical bounds. However, when selective framing, omission, or aggregation hide critical context or distort interpretation,
    the work crosses into deception. Because interpretation is subjective, these lines are rarely absolute, which means
    ethical visualization requires continuous reflection, disclosure of design intent, and a commitment to intellectual honesty.
